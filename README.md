# SPECTRUM_script
Script to run spectrum code by Richard O. Gary to calculate theoretical model spectrum.

Once you have generated the bash script named vsin.sh, excute it in the terminal.

Now you run the macroturb, which you will create a bash script named vm.sh. This can be later excuted in the terminal.

All the bash scripts take few minutes-hours to excute depending on your system. Sit back an have a coffee
